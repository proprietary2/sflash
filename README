Originally wrote this in C. It was a big mess--I'm a bad programmer. Took a week to write a non-functional version with leaks and overflows everywhere. Deleted it all and started fresh with C++, starting with a diagram of the main classes to get organized, and wrote most of it in a few hours. Give me C++ classes, templates, and standard library any day.
